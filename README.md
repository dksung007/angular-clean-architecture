# Angular Clean Architecture

This repository provides a clean architecture abstraction for Angular projects. The clean architecture pattern separates the concerns of an application into distinct layers, promoting modularity, testability, and maintainability. By adhering to clean architecture principles, developers can achieve a highly decoupled and scalable Angular application.
